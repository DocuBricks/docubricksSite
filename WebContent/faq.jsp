				<h2>FAQ</h2>
				
				<h3> Why DocuBricks? </h3>

				<p class=MsoNormal>
					We feel that the available tools were not sufficient to enable
					sharing useful open source hardware projects that integrate
					different types of components. These projects should be documented
					in a <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight: normal'>modular</b> fashion
					where it is easy to assess <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight: normal'>how</b>
					the project solves a problem, whether the information is <b
						style='mso-bidi-font-weight: normal'>complete</b> and if <b
						style='mso-bidi-font-weight: normal'>calibration</b> strategies
					etc. are given. We also want to provide a <b
						style='mso-bidi-font-weight: normal'>database for scientists</b>
					who would like to <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight: normal'>cite</b>
					the documentation and files in a publication as well as demonstrate
					the <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight: normal'>community impact</b> of
					each module (= important bricks) of their work (these features are
					coming soon). Is it not a shame for the openness of science, that
					experiment setups are rarely published? At the same time,
					scientists miss out on demonstrating the impact of these aspects of
					their work. Companies are also welcome to use the database and <b
						style='mso-bidi-font-weight: normal'>increase the visibility</b>
					of their open source products in comparison to hosting the
					instructions on their own page. We would like to see more projects
					and companies providing open source hardware solutions!
				</p>
				
				<p class=MsoNormal>
					If you think your project is not the right fit for this documentation
					tool or this repository, have a look at other repositories listed on our 
					<a href="http://docubricks.com/resources"> resources page</a>.
				</p>

				<h3>Do I have to upload my project in the DocuBricks format?</h3>
				<p class=MsoNormal>
					Yes. You may upload a different preliminary file but it will only
					become searchable and citable by DOI once the <span class=SpellE>DocuBricks</span>
					documentation is online. Please only make use of this in exceptions
					and when you intend to correct the format very soon. We insist on
					our format not only due to our database structure, but it makes it
					easier for the community to see that your project is complete and
					makes your sub-bricks re-usable &#8211; which in turn enables us to
					help you demonstrate the community impact of your project better.
				</p>
				
				<h3> Modularity - How to find an appropriate Brick structure for my project? </h3>
				<p class=MsoNormal>
					The following questions might help you in identifying appropriate sub-bricks:
					What parts of the hardware could be used as a component of another project
					or a variation of this hardware? What solutions do you find most noteworthy
					given your experiences during the design iterations? What separate actions
					does the hardware perform?
				</p>
				
				<h3>I want to reference my project elsewhere. How do I know the
					link will always work?</h3>
				<p class=MsoNormal>
					We solve this important question with the standard procedure in
					scientific literature: You can apply for a free Digital Object
					Identifier (DOI) with us, which is a short link that is curated by
					the <span class=MsoIntenseEmphasis><a
						href="http://www.doi.org/">International DOI Foundation (IDF)</a></span>
					Following this link, you will find your project on our page, but if
					we should ever have to shut down, we will (in fact: have to) make
					sure that your DOI is automatically redirected to a new place in
					the internet, where your project can still be found.
				</p>
				
				<h3>How do I choose the right licence?</h3>
				<p class=MsoNormal>
					Open source hardware (OSH) licences are still new and most likely
					not perfect. We provide you with a choice of preselected licences
					(no guarantee of successful use) that fulfil the <span
						class=MsoIntenseEmphasis> <a
						href="http://www.oshwa.org/definition/"><span
							class=MsoIntenseEmphasis><span
								style='text-decoration: none; text-underline: none'>open
									source hardware definition</span></span></a></span><span class=MsoIntenseEmphasis>
					</span>such as the<span class=MsoIntenseEmphasis> <a
						href="http://www.ohwr.org/projects/cernohl/wiki">CERN Open
							Hardware Licence</a></span> Most importantly, OSH licences must allow
					commercial use, because hardware does not come for free and it is
					not possible to distribute it for free in contrast to free and open
					source software. <span class=MsoIntenseEmphasis>Here </span>is a
					nice <a
						href="http://www.ladyada.net/library/openhardware/license.html">article</a>
					explaining the benefits of free-for-commercial-use licences.<span
						class=MsoIntenseEmphasis> </span>From our pre-selection, you
					mainly have the choice between share-alike licences, where
					modifications of your project have to be shared under the same open
					source licence, or permissive licences, which provide the freedom
					to choose a different licence for derivations of your project,
					including the potential waiving of the need for acknowledgement. If
					you want to know more, we also recommend this general <span

				<h3>Other questions</h3>
				<p class=MsoNormal>
					Please <a href="mailto:docubricks@gmail.com">send us an e-mail</a>
					with your user problem and we will try to answer or consider the
					feedback for the next update. Please understand that we might not
					be able to answer all questions directly. We are still actively
					developing this database and understand that a lot of features you
					might like to see are not yet implemented.
