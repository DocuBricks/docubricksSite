				The DocuBricks off-line Editor</p>
			<p>
				Our (offline) editor software helps you create a good documentation of your
				project. It generates the required XML format for uploads to this
				online repository. The editor helps you document a project along
				it's functionality and in a modular fashion. This is ideal to
				communicate your design rational with all files, media and details
				linked into place - this is different from a simpler linear
				assembly-only documentation for sold part-kits or repair guides and
				well suited for open hardware projects.</p>
			<p>	
				Please download our free and open source (java)
				editor software from the repository behind this link:</p>

			</p>
			<p>
				The editor will save your project into a XML document and a folder
				with your files (images, videos, CAD, etc.), which you can save on your PC
				or host for example on GitHub to re-open, modify or fork later. Once you
				are ready to submit the project to this repository, please upload the files under
				<a href="/mypage">submit</a>.</p>

			<p class="lead">Offline XML Viewer</p>
			<p>	
				Projects in this repository are now rendered online, so there is no need to use the following offline
				software. The following viewer is our first offline version and not a complete release. 
				The DocuBricks XML scheme is the standard we develop for effective open hardware documentations.
				It can be nicely rendered with a style sheet; on top of that our viewer creates interactive
				elements, visualises dependencies, adds lists and a total BOM.</p>

				your directory containing the documentation XML file.</p>
